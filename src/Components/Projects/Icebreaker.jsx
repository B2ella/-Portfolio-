         Every day, a quick 15-minute scrum/stand-up took place twice a day, usually at the start and end of the day to go over problems, 
         identify obstacles to task progression, or merely for topical discussions, as well as regular check-ins. Despite this being 
         a week-long project, we made use of sprint planning to the best of our abilities and shortened the sprint down to every couple 
         of days to plan what task needed to be carried out. At the end of the project, a sprint retrospective allowed discussions 
         around what was done well and poorly, as well as what changes could've been made and what could be improved for future sprints.<a href="/icebreaker agile.pdf"  className=' text-ibpurple ml-2 '>  Agile Methodologies (pdf)</a></p>

                Pair programming is such a beneficial and crucial tool to utilise, as it aids in stronger and better connections and 
                collaborations between developers, allows them to share best practices, and improves code quality. However, pair programming
                 isn't always a smooth transition for individuals, especially those used to working alone, so from this project, 
                 it's evident that finding new and innovative ways to help programmers get to know each other, perhaps in a 
                 less conventional way, can make for a smoother transition.</p>
                 
                 <p className="w-[35em] mt-10 text-justify text-2xl font-homemade font-500 leading-.82 -tracking-.04em mb-20">
                  Some things to improve would be to add more variety and 
                 situational questions, ones that allow individuals to identify each other's strengths and weaknesses, which would 
                 help them when working together. In terms of coding, going back and refactoring a lot of the code, making the site 
                 responsive, and utilising the database </p>

                The MVP was slightly ambitious given the one-week timeframe that needed to be stuck to; due to this, my team and I focused 
                more on completing the application and providing a functioning MVP rather than working in areas of individual weakness. 
                It would've been more beneficial to pick a smaller MVP and put more of an emphasis on the team working in areas that 
                they felt they needed to strengthen.

                At the start of the week, a lot of focus was put on exploring different ideas, and this took time away from planning 
                and development. Going back, I would put a time limit on idea exploration and spend a little more time looking at 
                who our users are, the problems they face, and the service we could provide them.

                Looking back, I would have liked to have carried out more user research via different methods as well. 
                Due to the limited time, we were unable to undertake comprehensive research, meaning that we perhaps missed out 
                on some valuable insight and feedback. The same goes for usability and testing; although testing was done on 
                the functionality of the app, it would've been beneficial to gain live feedback from users testing the application.
