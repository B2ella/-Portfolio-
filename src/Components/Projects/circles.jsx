        Circles is a platform that offers help and support to Link workers, enabling them to better and more seamlessly 
        integrate their clients that have been referred to them via the social prescribing scheme into their local 
        communities. The online platform provides quick and easy access to reliable information on local groups and 
        events and allows them to sign up and be a part of those events.</p>

         Social isolation is becoming more of an issue in today's society and can be caused for a number of reasons. Old age, 
         leaving the workforce, the death of a spouse, illness, or disability, to name a few. For these reasons, individuals 
         can struggle to integrate into their local communities and often distance themselves. This is where social prescribing 
         steps in. Social prescribing, also known as community referral, is when a health professional refers individuals to 
         link workers, who will then try to connect them to support in their community. Some of the main roles of a social 
         prescribing link worker are to help strengthen communities, support existing community groups, and encourage individuals' 
         active involvement in their local communities.</p>

        During this phase, the implementation of market research through competitor analysis via SWOT, thorough user 
        research, usability, navigation, layout, and design really aided in analysing the current market and the 
        opportunities available.<br/>

        <br/> Currently, there are no other apps or companies that provide the same services designed to assist and support
        link workers. However, there are some that serve to tackle similar issues, so I focused on the apps and 
        platforms that provided a solution to the issue at hand to see what they did well and where there might be 
        opportunities and a UPS.</p>

Accessibility was at the heart of the visual design for the Circles application; from our research, we understood 
that our application needed to be as accessible as possible to cater to our vulnerable target audience. So we 
implemented a minimal design with bold type, easy navigation, and limited gesture control. It's worth noting 
that due to the sensitive nature of the application, a calming colour palette and muted tones were implemented 
to convey and emote this.</p>

<p className="w-[35em] mt-10 text-justify text-[1.6vw] font-homemade font-500 leading-[1] -tracking-.04em mb-20">
Loneliness is an epidemic in today's society; an issue that once mainly impacted the older and vulnerable generation 
due to the rise of social media and technological advancements now impacts the majority for a plethora of reasons, 
making individuals more disconnected from their local communities than ever. Social prescribing is an important 
solution to this matter and something that can continue to take the pressure off of healthcare professionals who 
normally aid these individuals.</p>

<p className="w-[35em] text-justify text-[1.6vw] font-homemade font-500 leading-[1] -tracking-.04em mb-20">
There is a great opportunity to help and support the social prescribing scheme, the Link workers, 
and the vulnerable individuals that benefit from it most through platforms like "Circles." 
If given more time, additional features would've been implemented, which would've truly added 
more value to the application and better supported our Link workers.</p>

          assigned clients, how involved they are in the community, and how they are getting along in their groups and events.</li><br/>

          <li>Further work needs to be done on the responsiveness of the site so that it adjusts depending on the environment it's 
          being viewed in. (MVP was to create a web application due to research from Link workers saying that their usual procedure when 
          dealing with their clients is to look at groups in their office.)</li><br/>
          
          <li>Schedule and carry out more real-world testing and empathy mapping with the target audience. Collect feedback and 
          integrate this into a new sprint.</li><br/>

          <li>Create an account platform for group administrators to set up new groups on the platform, with the intention of making 
          requests to join groups directly through the application possible.</li><br/>

          <li>Further integration of Next Auth with more tables added to the database for authorising different accounts.</li><br/>

          <li>Delve further into accessibility and aim to achieve 100 on Lighthouse reports. Increase the ARIA coverage on the application.</li><br/>

Throughout this project, there were countless challenges that presented themselves: the complexities of the chosen topic, 
the topic's sensitivity, market research, to name a few, but here are the most pertinent ones.</p>

Free Plan Limitations</h2>
<p className="w-[35em] mt-10 text-justify text-2xl font-homemade font-500 leading-.82 -tracking-.04em mb-20">
Database connections were a challenge throughout the project, as we were only limited to five connections on a
free plan for a group of six individuals. This made running the servers during development a balancing act when
sometimes required more connections. To get around this, we used pair planning whenever possible.Â

CSS consistency and Responsiveness</h2>
<p className="w-[35em] mt-10 text-justify text-2xl font-homemade font-500 leading-.82 -tracking-.04em mb-20">
Responsiveness was one of the roadblocks that we faced as a team, and I think this was a particular issue due to us 
not dealing with it until we had finished our MVP. If I could go back, I would work on the responsiveness as we went, 
or if we had the resources available, I would have a team working on the CSS and responsiveness.Â

Deployment and Merging</h2>
<p className="w-[35em] mt-10 text-justify text-2xl font-homemade font-500 leading-.82 -tracking-.04em mb-20">
Despite there being a good merging policy in place, we occasionally experienced roadblocks, for example, 
package lock errors and empty components. Going back, I would make changes to the merging policy and 
suggest merging more often and, if possible, way before deployment.
